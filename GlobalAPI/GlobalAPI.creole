== GlobalAPI ==

GlobalAPI provides the latest API tools for Skript to give you a lot of nice little features which addons haven't provided or are impossible without some sort of external interface.

=== Usage ===

GlobalAPI is split into 4 different API's which have different abilities! To keep this thread tidy, and the forums less spammy, I have put their pages onto a seperate GitHub page:
* GlobalTime - Allows you to get the time of any timezone in the world - 
* QueryAPI - Get the information of a Minecraft server -
* Mojang Service Status (MMS) - Check which Mojang services are online/offline - 
* HasPaid API - When a player joins they're checked to see if they've paid - 

=== How it works ===

GlobalAPI uses features such as skQuery's 'text from "%url%"' to provide the HasPaid API and the MSS API, however for features like GlobalTime and QueryAPI I have created a PHP side in which allows GlobalAPI to do them extra features.

=== Uses? ===

As there are so many features existing in GlobalAPI, there are a lot of uses! I have listed a few below:\\
GlobalTime:
* Live clocks
* Server time

QueryAPI:
* Check the status of Minecraft servers on a Bungee
* In-Game stats

MMS:
* Warn users when Mojang Services are offline
* Check status of the services in-game

HasPaid API
* Prevent premium users joining cracked servers
* Check if a cracked user is premium
